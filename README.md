# Calorie-Burnt-Prediction

**Overview**
This project involves analyzing exercise and calorie data to predict calories burnt using various machine learning models. The primary objectives are to explore the data, train different regression models, and evaluate their performance.

**Files**
calories.csv: Contains data related to calories burnt.
exercise.csv: Contains data related to exercise activities.
model_training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating machine learning models.
app.py: Streamlit application to interact with the trained model.

1) Setup and Installation
    Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository

2) Set Up Environment

3)  Install Dependencies
    Install the required packages using pip:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Streamlit Application:
    streamlit run app.py
    
**Usage**
Open model_training.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
Use the Streamlit app (app.py) to interact with the trained model and make predictions.

**Notes**
Ensure that you have requirements.txt for all necessary libraries. If not, you can generate it with pip freeze > requirements.txt.
Sensitive information like API keys and passwords should be stored in a .env file, which should not be uploaded to GitHub.
